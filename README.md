# Mubashar
Simple Restful-based news website 

Mubashar presents a simple fluid interface that allows users to access articles collected from all over the world from any country desired (contingent to availability). It’s a news enthusiast’s one stop site for diverse news powered by the News API web service. The interaction starts with searching through the country lists via the REST Countries API in the search bar, which generates a list of ISO 3166-1 2-letter or 3-letter country codes and appends it to the news query variable in the News API URL to fetch the news articles form that selected country.
Mubashar also allows users to share these articles via Facebook or WhatsApp social plugins APIs, encouraging a social interaction between the user and others throughout the world.
As a fun fact, Mubashar means "current"" or “latest”, a name fitting of this web application features.
